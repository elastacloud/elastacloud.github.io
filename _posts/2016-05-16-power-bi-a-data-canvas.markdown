title: Power BI; a data canvas.
layout: post
---
Elastacloud built out and published the Power BI Calendar last year and have continued to expand our business extending Power BI with custom visuals. Our approach is such that with the right tools and the right approach you can make Power BI a data canvas - a technically complete and ready to go back end for data driven tools. 

We believe that an immersive experience is the way forward for Data Vis and there will be brilliant solutions coming that combine 3d environments, augmented reality and holographic computing. The technical barriers are on the UI tier and not the back end analytics system, which PowerBI is the facade for a long chain of analytics technologies (data lake et al, the things Elastacloud does for a living). 

In order to break down that technical UI barrier, I came to WebGL and BabylonJS. It's right where I wanted it to be. The team I have at Elastacloud is Microsoft oriented (I'm an MVP and Microsoft Regional Director, if that means anything to you :) ) and we found PowerBI a great toolset (typescript, html5). BabylonJS fits nicely into that, and i actually didn't know the guys involved were Microsofties until I was looking at your Twitter profile.
